Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset
Version 1.1 (modified by James J. Barrecchia on 6/17/2014

This file is the code book for the Data Cleaning Project and defines the output.txt file created as 
result of my analysis.  It consists of several columns generated during my work, and includes the 
average column values required to complete the assignment.

activity - this value was added to the data set by appending the acitivity codes from the y_train 
and y_test data files to the x_train and x_test data file and then translating them to the descriptive 
values contained in the activity labels file.

subjects - this value was added to the data set by appending the subject_train and subject_test files 
to the x_train and x_test data file.  No further translation was necessary as there were no subject 
names to correspond to the subject values.

The remaining columns (listed below in order) contain the summarized values from the original data set.  
The names were kept the same for easy mapping and validation back to the original, but they contain 
the summarized values.
